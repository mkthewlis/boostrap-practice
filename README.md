# Code Institute: mini-project

Hello and welcome to another mini-project with the Code Institute.

The focus of this project was the learn how to incorporate Bootstrap in my work. The unit included what to think about when working with frameworks, how grid systems work and how to use Bootsrap to make a website responsive to different screen sizes.
This unit also focused on preparation before the first Milestone Project. 

The basic finished project can be found on the following link: https://mkthewlis.github.io/boostrap-practice/
